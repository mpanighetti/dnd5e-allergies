# Chapter 1: Roll for Allergen

As in life, we do not get to decide what might trigger an allergic reaction. Rather, these afflictions are intrinsically associated with our very physical being, often from birth. In game terms, it should come down to a roll of the dice.

## Allergens

After you have completed all other steps of character creation, roll percentile dice and consult the **Allergens** table to determine your character's allergen category, then roll on any subsequent tables to find your specific allergen. It is important to save your allergen rolls for last so that you do not retroactively make character trait decisions that conflict with your allergens; they should ideally be totally unaffected by your background decisions (you will typically be prompted to re-roll in the case of such conflicts).

Alternatively, you can pick a specific allergen from one of the following tables and work it into your character's background. Maybe they are trying to appeal to the gods to cure their silver allergy. It could be the foundation of an epic personal quest! In this case, consider making character decisions with the allergen in mind; for example, a character with a metal allergy might be well-suited to the druid class, as such practicioners typically avoid wearing metal as a lifestyle choice anyway.

Many of these allergens don't make much practical sense, but it's best not to think about it too hard.

### Mundane Allergens

You have a more common allergen triggered by environmental factors, or exposure to relatively mundane materials. Since these do not necessarily match existing game mechanics, making an allergy Saving Throw will depend on the specific rules of the allergen as listed in the **Mundane** table. If you roll a mundane material that is referenced in your proficiencies or starting equipment, roll on this table again to receive a replacement allergen.

##### Mundane

| d6 | Allergen |
|:-:|:-|
| 1 | **Dust**. If you are in an environment the Game Master determines to be dusty (such as a long-abandoned building), when you first arrive and for each hour spent there, you have a 10% chance of needing to make an allergy Saving Throw (increases by 10% for every hour spent in that environment beyond the first). |
| 2 | A **food** ingredient of your choice. Any time you eat food prepared by someone other than yourself, it has a 10% chance of containing your food allergen, triggering an allergy Saving Throw. |
| 3 | An **herb** of your choice. Any time you drink a potion prepared by someone other than yourself, it has a 10% chance of containing your herb allergen, triggering an allergy Saving Throw. |
| 4 | **Metal**. You must make an allergy Saving Throw any time you make physical contact with a metallic object or creature. |
| 5 | **Mold**. If you are in an environment the GM determines to be moldy (such as a cave), when you first arrive and for each hour spent there, you have a 10% chance of needing to make an allergy Saving Throw (increases by 10% for every hour spent in that environment beyond the first). |
| 6 | **Pollen**. If you are in an environment the GM determines to have pollen in the air (such as an open field of flowers, or a windy climate in springtime), when you first arrive and for each hour spent there, you have a 10% chance of needing to make an allergy Saving Throw (increases by 10% for every hour spent in that environment beyond the first). |

### Planar Allergens

You must make an allergy Saving Throw when you enter the corresponding plane of existence, if you are within 30 feet of a portal to that plane, or if you are within 30 feet of a creature or object from that plane. You repeat this Saving Throw for every hour spent on that plane or in range of the portal or native creatures and objects. If you roll the plane of your origin, roll on this table again to receive a replacement allergen.

##### Planes of Existence

| d10 | Allergen |
|:-:|:-|
| 1 | The Material Plane |
| 2 | The Ethereal Plane |
| 3 | The Astral Plane |
| 4 | The Elemental Plane of Air |
| 5 | The Elemental Plane of Earth |
| 6 | The Elemental Plane of Fire |
| 7 | The Elemental Plane of Water |
| 8 | An Outer Plane (roll on the **Alignments** table; you are allergic to any planes of the corresponding alignment; if you roll **Unaligned**, you are allergic to the spaces between planes) |
| 9 | The Far Realm |
| 10 | Demiplanes and extradimensional spaces (such as the inside of a bag of holding) |
