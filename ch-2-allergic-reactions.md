# Chapter 2: Allergic Reactions

When you come in contact with your allergen, there is a chance that you might suffer an allergic reaction. In real life, such reactions can range from a sniffly nose to rashes, all the way up to life-threatening responses such as anaphylaxis. In this epic fantasy setting, these conditions are approximated using the Exhausted condition, with each additional level corresponding with the severity of your reaction. There is also a chance of temporarily suffering disadvantage on skill checks, or a random magical side effect.

## Allergy Saving Throws

Each time you are exposed to a substance to which you are allergic, you must succeed on a Constitution Saving Throw or suffer an allergic reaction. The DC for this Saving Throw uses the following equation:

    Allergy Saving Throw DC =  10 + (2 × the number of times you previously made an allergy Saving Throw since your last Long Rest)

For example, if you have already made two allergy Saving Throws earlier in the day, the DC on your next Saving Throw is 14. Note that your past Saving Throws are factored in whether or not you successfully saved.

On a failed save, you must roll on the **Allergic Reactions** table to determine your specific reaction. You cannot have an allergic reaction from the same triggering allergen more than once per hour.

##### Allergic Reactions

| d10  | Reaction |
|:----:|:-|
| 1    | You suffer one level of Exhaustion. |
| 2-4  | Your sneezing and sniffling makes it difficult to focus and move quietly. For the next hour, you have disadvantage on Stealth and Perception checks, and you are unable to maintain Concentration when casting spells. |
| 5-7  | Your puffy eyes and runny nose are unbecoming and distracting to others. Until you complete a Short or Long Rest, you have disadvantage on Charisma-based skill checks. |
| 8-9  | Your allergen has nauseated you. Until you complete a Short or Long Rest, you automatically fail all Constitution Saving Throws, and you are unable to keep any food, drink, or potions down. |
|  10  | Roll on wild magic surge table for a random magical effect, such as the Wild Magic Surge table in the _Player's Handbook_ or the [Wild Magic Effects Table from amiplayingright](https://at.tumblr.com/amiplayingright/wild-magic-effects-the-homebrewery/nhe9h81pfz18). If that effect is a spell: it doesn't require Concentration; it lasts for its full duration; and the Spell Save DC is either your own Spell Save DC (if you have the ability to cast a spell) or 8 + your Proficiency Bonus + your Constitution modifier (if you cannot normally cast spells).

## Self-Allergies

Generally speaking, it is not possible to be allergic to yourself (otherwise, how would you have gotten all the way to adventurer status?), but in some rare situations you might temporarily or permanently change states such that you take on the form of your own allergen. This could happen if polymorphed into a beast, or if your alignment is changed through divine intervention or infernal contracts. In these cases, you would make allergy Saving Throws as normal, but you can suffer no more than two levels of allergy-triggered Exhaustion at once using yourself as an allergen.
