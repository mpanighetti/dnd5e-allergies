# Chapter 3: Treating Allergies

## Natural Recovery

The most effective treatment for allergic reactions is to remove exposure to the offending allergen and to get some rest. Removing all levels of Exhaustion (either by finishing Long Rests with food and drink or by magical means) restores you to normal health. After you have been restored in this manner, you do not need to make allergy Saving Throws for the next 24 hours.

#### Attributes

_Potion, uncommon_

When you drink this clear potion, you are subject to the following effects:
- You immediately remove all effects of allergic reactions, including any levels of Exhaustion triggered by allergic reactions.
- For the next week, you automatically succeed in all allergy Saving Throws.
- At the end of the first Long Rest you take after drinking this potion, you gain 2d4 + 2 Temporary Hit Points.

#### Description

Some plants contain natural chemicals and compounds that can suppress a creature's allergic reactions when concentrated into a _potion of allergy relief_. These herbs are so rare that they are largely unknown within the Material Plane, and those who have encountered or heard of them often attribute their curative properties to a powerful magic or divine gift. Some worlds may have no such natural remedies at all, or have simply not discovered them yet.

Though the effects of such a potion would only be temporary, for those afflicted by allergies, they are highly sought after. Their ability to suppress the effects of allergens allow adventurers to imbibe them in preparation of a journey where exposure to allergens might be anticipated, such as a lengthy spelunking into moldy caverns, or a planar excursion into the Far Realm.

#### Purchasing

Even if your setting includes plants with allergy relief properties, they are unlikely to be found in most apothecaries. If your players start seeking out such remedies, there is a 10% chance that herbalists in a given town have _potions of allergy relief_ in stock; otherwise, they can only provide vague guidance as to where the herbs might be found in nature. If in stock, a single _potion of allergy relief_ costs 500 gp.

#### Crafting

With sufficient time and access to the appropriate raw materials, skilled herbalists can create a _potion of allergy relief_ by using the crafting downtime activity mechanic. This requires Proficiency with an herbalism kit and access to allergy-relieving herbs. The act of locating and gathering the herbs for processing into a single potion might be the foundation of its own difficult quest.

## What Doesn't Work

It is important to note the following aspects of allergies:

- No creature can have resistance or immunity to their allergen, even if they have resistance or immunity to a related condition, damage, or other effect. Allergy Saving Throws are resolved independently of any such resistances and immunities.
- Allergens are not poisons, or anything that could similarly be detected as a harmful substance by mundane or magical means, unless you are specifically looking for the presence of the offending material, creature, or planar energies.
- Allergies and allergic reactions are not curses (even if they might sometimes feel like it), and thus cannot be alleviated by any effects that remove curses.

## Curing Allergies

Most creatures simply learn how to live with their conditions and avoid triggers when possible, and accept that there is no normal method to remove the ailment.

Nothing short of divine intervention or very powerful magic (such as a carefully-worded _wish_ spell) can permanently remove an allergy from a creature. This could be granted as the terms of a fiend's infernal contract, or come as a divine boon from one's deity, but in any case would likely come at a great personal expense, or be the reward of a long and difficult holy quest.
