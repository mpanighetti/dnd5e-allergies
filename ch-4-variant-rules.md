# Chapter 4: Variant Rules

If you are running a game that is attempting to be more "realistic" in its treatment of allergies, you can drop the more exotic possibilities from the **Allergens** and **Allergic Reactions** tables, such as the alignment-based allergens or the wild magic surge allergic reaction, or possibly forgo the reactions and only take a level of Exhaustion on a failed Saving Throw.

On the other hand, a setting where wild magic is a widespread fundamental aspect of reality might have random magical effects _always_ be the reaction to allergens, or you might wish to have everyone's allergies correspond to a status condition (the Poisoned condition would be appropriate), possibly ignoring any normal immunity to this condition.

This system is flexible enough for any such desired customizations; simply re-roll on the **Allergens** and **Allergic Reactions** tables if they land on an excluded result, or limit rolls to specific permitted tables and results.
