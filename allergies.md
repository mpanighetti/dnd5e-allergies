# Allergies

## Introduction

Monarchs and commoners, heroes and villains, and creatures of all makes across all planes of existence in all states of life (or unlife) can be susceptible to the effects of an overactive immune system. All it takes is an errant mote of dander, a puff of pollen, or the wrong substance ingested, and your entire day can be ruined.

This supplement describes how to assign an allergen to your character, and how it manifests mechanically within the game.

## Roll for Allergen

As in life, we do not get to decide what might trigger an allergic reaction. Rather, these afflictions are intrinsically associated with our very physical being, often from birth. In game terms, it should come down to a roll of the dice.

### Allergens

After you have completed all other steps of character creation, roll percentile dice and consult the **Allergens** table to determine your character's allergen category, then roll on any subsequent tables to find your specific allergen. It is important to save your allergen rolls for last so that you do not retroactively make character trait decisions that conflict with your allergens; they should ideally be totally unaffected by your background decisions (you will typically be prompted to reroll in the case of such conflicts).

Alternatively, you can pick a specific allergen from one of the following tables and work it into your character's background. Maybe they are trying to appeal to the gods to cure their silver allergy. It could be the foundation of an epic personal quest! In this case, consider making character decisions with the allergen in mind; for example, a character with a metal allergy might be well-suited to the druid class, as such practicioners typically avoid wearing metal as a lifestyle choice anyway.

Many of these allergens don't make much practical sense, but it's best not to think about it too hard.

### Mundane Allergens

You have a more common allergen triggered by environmental factors, or exposure to relatively mundane materials. Since these do not necessarily match existing game mechanics, making an allergy saving throw will depend on the specific rules of the allergen as listed in the **Mundane** table. If you roll a mundane material that is referenced in your proficiencies or starting equipment, roll on this table again to receive a replacement allergen.

##### Mundane

| d6 | Allergen |
|:-:|:-|
| 1 | **Dust**. If you are in an environment the Game Master determines to be dusty (such as a long-abandoned building), when you first arrive and for each hour spent there, you have a 10% chance of needing to make an allergy saving throw (increases by 10% for every hour spent in that environment beyond the first). |
| 2 | A **food** ingredient of your choice. Any time you eat food prepared by someone other than yourself, it has a 10% chance of containing your food allergen, triggering an allergy saving throw. |
| 3 | An **herb** of your choice. Any time you drink a potion prepared by someone other than yourself, it has a 10% chance of containing your herb allergen, triggering an allergy saving throw. |
| 4 | **Metal**. You must make an allergy saving throw any time you make physical contact with a metallic object or creature. |
| 5 | **Mold**. If you are in an environment the GM determines to be moldy (such as a cave), when you first arrive and for each hour spent there, you have a 10% chance of needing to make an allergy saving throw (increases by 10% for every hour spent in that environment beyond the first). |
| 6 | **Pollen**. If you are in an environment the GM determines to have pollen in the air (such as an open field of flowers, or a windy climate in springtime), when you first arrive and for each hour spent there, you have a 10% chance of needing to make an allergy saving throw (increases by 10% for every hour spent in that environment beyond the first). |

### Planar Allergens

You must make an allergy saving throw when you enter the corresponding plane of existence, if you are within 30 feet of a portal to that plane, or if you are within 30 feet of a creature or object from that plane. You repeat this saving throw for every hour spent on that plane or in range of the portal or native creatures and objects. If you roll the plane of your origin, roll on this table again to receive a replacement allergen.

##### Planes of Existence

| d10 | Allergen |
|:-:|:-|
| 1 | The Material Plane |
| 2 | The Ethereal Plane |
| 3 | The Astral Plane |
| 4 | The Elemental Plane of Air |
| 5 | The Elemental Plane of Earth |
| 6 | The Elemental Plane of Fire |
| 7 | The Elemental Plane of Water |
| 8 | An Outer Plane (roll on the **Alignments** table; you are allergic to any planes of the corresponding alignment; if you roll **Unaligned**, you are allergic to the spaces between planes) |
| 9 | The Far Realm |
| 10 | Demiplanes and extradimensional spaces (such as the inside of a bag of holding) |

## Allergic Reactions

When you come in contact with your allergen, there is a chance that you might suffer an allergic reaction. In real life, such reactions can range from a sniffly nose to rashes, all the way up to life-threatening responses such as anaphylaxis. In this epic fantasy setting, these conditions are approximated using the exhaustion levels system, with each additional level of exhaustion corresponding with the severity of your reaction. There is also a chance of temporarily suffering disadvantage on skill checks, or a random magical side effect.

### Allergy Saving Throws

Each time you are exposed to a substance to which you are allergic, you must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or suffer an allergic reaction. The DC for this saving throw uses the following equation:

    Allergy Saving Throw DC =  10 + (2 × the number of times you previously made an allergy saving throw since your last long rest)

For example, if you have already made two allergy saving throws earlier in the day, the DC on your next saving throw is 14. Note that your past saving throws are factored in whether or not you successfully saved.

On a failed save, you must roll on the **Allergic Reactions** table to determine your specific reaction. You cannot have an allergic reaction from the same triggering allergen more than once per hour.

##### Allergic Reactions

| d10  | Reaction |
|:----:|:-|
| 1    | You suffer one level of exhaustion. |
| 2-4  | Your sneezing and sniffling makes it difficult to focus and move quietly. For the next hour, you have disadvantage on Stealth and Perception checks, and you are unable to maintain concentration when casting spells. |
| 5-7  | Your puffy eyes and runny nose are unbecoming and distracting to others. For the next hour, you have disadvantage on Charisma-based skill checks. |
| 8-9  | Your allergen has nauseated you. Until your next short rest, you automatically fail all Constitution saving throws, and you are unable to keep any food, drink, or potions down. |
|  10  | Roll on a table for a random magical effect, such as the Wild Magic Surge table in the _Player's Handbook_ or the [Wild Magic Effects Table from amiplayingright](https://at.tumblr.com/amiplayingright/wild-magic-effects-the-homebrewery/nhe9h81pfz18). If that effect is a spell: it doesn’t require concentration; it lasts for its full duration; and the spell save DC is either your own spell save DC (if you have the ability to cast a spell) or 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier (if you cannot normally cast spells). If the effect has a duration associated with combat but you are not currently in combat, it lasts for one hour, or until combat occurs and the stated duration passes.

### Self-Allergies

Generally speaking, it is not possible to be allergic to yourself (otherwise, how would you have gotten all the way to adventurer status?), but in some rare situations you might temporarily or permanently change states such that you take on the form of your own allergen. This could happen if polymorphed into a beast, or if your alignment is changed through divine intervention or infernal contracts. In these cases, you would make allergy saving throws as normal, but you can suffer no more than two levels of allergy-triggered exhaustion at once using yourself as an allergen.

## Treating Allergies

### Natural Recovery

The most effective treatment for allergic reactions is to remove exposure to the offending allergen and to get some rest. Removing all levels of exhaustion (either by finishing long rests with food and drink or by magical means) restores you to normal health. After you have been restored in this manner, you do not need to make allergy saving throws for the next 24 hours.

### Potion of Allergy Relief

Some plants contain natural chemicals and compounds that can suppress a creature's allergic reactions when concentrated into a _potion of allergy relief_. These herbs are so rare that they are largely unknown within the Material Plane, and those who have encountered or heard of them often attribute their curative properties to a powerful magic or divine gift. Some worlds may have no such natural remedies at all, or have simply not discovered them yet.

Though the effects of such a potion would only be temporary, for those afflicted by allergies, they are highly sought after. Their ability to suppress the effects of allergens allow adventurers to imbibe them in preparation of a journey where exposure to allergens might be anticipated, such as a lengthy spelunking into moldy caverns, or a planar excursion into the Far Realm.

> **[Potion of Allergy Relief](potion-of-allergy-relief.md)**
> 
> _Potion, uncommon_
> 
> When you drink this clear potion, you are subject to the following effects:
> - You immediately remove all effects of allergic reactions, including any levels of exhaustion triggered by allergic reactions.
> - For the next week, you automatically succeed in all allergy saving throws.
> - At the end of the first long rest you take after drinking this potion, you gain 2d4 + 2 temporary hit points.

#### Purchasing

Even if your setting includes plants with allergy relief properties, they are unlikely to be found in most apothecaries. If your players start seeking out such remedies, there is a 10% chance that herbalists in a given town have _potions of allergy relief_ in stock; otherwise, they can only provide vague guidance as to where the herbs might be found in nature. If in stock, a single _potion of allergy relief_ costs 500 gp.

#### Crafting

With sufficient time and access to the appropriate raw materials, skilled herbalists can create a _potion of allergy relief_ by using the crafting downtime activity mechanic. This requires proficiency with an herbalism kit and access to allergy-relieving herbs. The act of locating and gathering the herbs for processing into a single potion might be the foundation of its own difficult quest.

### What Doesn't Work

It is important to note the following aspects of allergies:

- No creature can have resistance or immunity to their allergen, even if they have resistance or immunity to a related condition, damage, or other effect. Allergy saving throws are resolved independently of any such resistances and immunities.
- Allergens are not poisons, or anything that could similarly be detected as a harmful substance by mundane or magical means, unless you are specifically looking for the presence of the offending material, creature, or planar energies.
- Allergies and allergic reactions are not curses (even if they might sometimes feel like it), and thus cannot be alleviated by any effects that remove curses.

### Curing Allergies

Most creatures simply learn how to live with their conditions and avoid triggers when possible, and accept that there is no normal method to remove the ailment.

Nothing short of divine intervention or very powerful magic (such as a carefully-worded _wish_ spell) can permanently remove an allergy from a creature. This could be granted as the terms of a fiend's infernal contract, or come as a divine boon from one's deity, but in any case would likely come at a great personal expense, or be the reward of a long and difficult holy quest.

## Variant Rules

If you are running a game that is attempting to be more "realistic" in its treatment of allergies, you can drop the more exotic possibilities from the **Allergens** and **Allergic Reactions** tables, such as the alignment-based allergens or the random magical effect allergic reaction, or possibly forgo the reactions and only take a level of exhaustion on a failed save.

On the other hand, a setting where random magic is a widespread fundamental force of reality might have random magical effects _always_ be the reaction to allergens, or you might wish to have everyone's allergies correspond to a status condition (the poisoned condition would be appropriate), possibly ignoring any normal immunity to this condition.

This system is flexible enough for any such desired customizations; simply reroll on the **Allergens** and **Allergic Reactions** tables if they land on an excluded result, or limit rolls to specific permitted tables and results.
