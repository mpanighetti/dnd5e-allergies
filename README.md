# Allergies

Monarchs and commoners, heroes and villains, and creatures of all makes across all planes of existence in all states of life (or unlife) can be susceptible to the effects of an overactive immune system. All it takes is an errant mote of dander, a puff of pollen, or the wrong substance ingested, and your entire day can be ruined.

This 5e homebrew supplement describes how to assign an allergen to your character, and how it manifests mechanically within the game.

## Compatibility

This work is compatible with Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition. It makes the following modifications from _Systems Reference Document 5.1_:

- "Species" is used in place of "race". "Ancestry" or "variant" is used in place of "subrace".
- This document uses new traits called **Condition Resistance** and **Condition Vulnerability**. Resistance to a condition means that a creature has Advantage on saving throws made to resist that condition, and vulnerability to a condition means that a creature has Disadvantage on such saving throws.
- Damage and condition resistances, vulnerabilities, and immunities are grouped together in features and stat blocks as **Resistances**, **Vulnerabilities**, and **Immunities** respectively.
- Resistance, vulnerability, and immunity to Poison apply to both the damage type and the Poisoned condition.
